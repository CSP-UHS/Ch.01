This is the master branch


Define Forking: when developers take a copy of source code from one software package amd start independent development
on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software

Define Cloning: making an exact copy of an object, frequently under the paradigm of instance-based programming, or
object-oriented programming

Define Branching: an instruction that tells a computer to begin executing a different part of a program rather than
executing statements one-by-one. Branching is implemented as a series of control flow statements in high-level
programming languages.

Define Committing: adds to the latest changes to the source code to the repository, making these changes part of the
head revision of the repository.

Define Merging: a fundamental operation that reconciles multiple changes made to a version-controlled collection of
files.

Define Pushing: a system in which data is "pushed" to a user's device rather than "pulled" by the user. In other words,
the data transfer is initiated by the server rather than the client.

Define Pull Request: a method of submitting contributions to an open development project
